# Release Boss

![Build Status](https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Feeling like you need another boss? We've got you covered. 
Release boss is your all in one automated boss. It will nag you for triage things you should have done but didn't do.

> It's just that we're putting new coversheets on all the TPS reports *before* they go out now. So if you could just remember to do that from now on, that'd be great ...
